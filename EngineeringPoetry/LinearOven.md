## Sonnet for the Linear Oven

The furtive catalyst begins apart.  
The shimmering heat of the furnace looms.  
The energy of air is given to start.  
The music from which connection blooms.  

As bonds begin their activation inspires  
Cascades of pairings we can’t quantify.  
The more the exothermic dance conspires  
The chains make bonds with chains and vitrify.

But too many paths foment the dancers’ distress.  
When heat is trapped between the bonded mates  
It dissipates as fruitless waste unless  
It finds a fertile place to incubate.  

To cure, provide both path and convection.  
Our polymers, like us, require direction.
