## The Only Law is Thermodynamcs

The only law is thermodynamics
We all immortal mortal _S_ beset
Are subject to our atoms' genetics

The lovers who lie in beds or in hammocks
Their tenderest carees longs to forget
The only law is thermodynamics

The scarcity in drought or in panics
The leader's maw breathes words to forget
The only law is thermodynamics

--
Whose laws conceived in posthumous pippettes
Are subject to our atoms genetics
The only law is thermodynamics
